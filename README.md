# NodeJsApp

This is my first NodeJS App I built on the same day I learned it!

A couple of things that were different than the React Version

- Authentication is more simple as I did not want to use many modules. Here I just used basic-auth.
- EJS was used for templating. Many of these things were new to me but was not really hard to learn and apply.
- CSS was used for each individual ejs file.

I would definitely love feedback on what I can do better and improve.
